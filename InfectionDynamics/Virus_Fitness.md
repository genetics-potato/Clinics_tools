## Virus Fitness

> http://public.wsu.edu/~broosien/VirusFitness.html

What one means by virus fitness depends on the context. There are two ways in which to think about virus evolution: within host evolution and between host evolution. Fitness refers to some-thing's ability to reproduce itself. If we are concerned with within host evolution we usually want to look at some measure of how quickly a virus can make copies of itself. If we are concerned with between host evolution, it is more appropriate to look at the number of new hosts can be infected by a host infected with a particular strain of virus.

When we are concerned with within host evolution we want a measure of how fast a virus can increase its numbers with in the host. This can be done my measuring the concentration of virus particles in host tissue.

When we are concerned with between host evolution; we usually define fitness by how well a virus can spread through a host population. The measure of fitness most commonly used in this case is the basic reproduction number R0. R0 is the number of individuals which will be infected by introducing an infected individual into a population of uninfected individuals. This measure of fitness can be used for any parasite that is transmitted from one host to another. R0 must be greater than one in order for the virus to spread. That is each infected host must infect more than one host for a virus to spread over the long term. Simple mathematical models of parasite transmission have shown that R0 is a good measure of virus fitness if the parasite - host system has reached a state where the number of infected individuals does not change. However for viruses which rarely reach a state at which the number of infected hosts in a population is not changing, it may be more important to look at how fast an infected individual can infect uninfected individuals.
